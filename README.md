Below are the projects that I have worked on. Projects are labeled **Level 1 (Basic)**, **Level 2 (Intermediate)**, and **Level 3 (Advanced)** based on the amount and difficulty of programming skills used. The levels are assigned according to my programming abilities and knowledge. 

# [Project 1: Bookdown - R, SQL, Web Scraping](https://econ380w21.github.io/bpRaRw1Ky1RyM8Y1h/) (Level 2)

A book that I assembled upon completion of DataCamp Courses with notes and examples on the basics of R, SQL and Web Scraping.

- Introduction to the **Tidyverse**, Data Visualization with **ggplot2** 
- Categorical & Quantitative Data
- Cleaning, Joining and Data Manipulation(Basic Feature Engieering)
- Introduction to **SQL**
- Joining Data in **SQL**
- Web Scraping in **R**
- Simpe Linear Regression , Multiple Linear Regression

# [Project 2: Amazon Books Best Sellers](https://github.com/raianrith/Amazon_BestSeller) (Level 1)

- Short Blog on Yearly Best Selling Books by Amazon from years (2009 - 2019)
- Data Collected from **Kaggle**
- Basic **data cleaning**, **data manipulation**, **feature engineering**, **data visualization**
- Used **ggplot** and **ggplotly** to create **Interactive Plot**
- Project strictly for implementation of **ggplot** and **ggplotly** abilities. **Blog and plot conclusions may/may not be accurate** due to insufficient data.

# [Project 3: The iPhone Overview](https://github.com/raianrith/iPhone_RShiny) (Level 2)

- An R Shiny App  which helps users visualize **4 variables (iPhone Model, Price, Battery Life & Sales)**  in various ways using **6 different user inputs**.
- Data gathered through **Web Scraping** using **Selector Gadget**
- Project includes **Data Taming**, **Data Tidying**, **Data Transformation**, **Data Manipulation**, and **Joining Data**
- Project includes advanced **ggplot** graphs
- User gets to switch between 2 Types of graphs (**Scatterplots** connected by **segments** and a user initiated **correlation**)
- Type 1 graph helps users visualize the Sales, Battery Life, and Launch Price for each type of model of iPhones since iPhone 3g
- Type 2 graph shows the correlations between any two among the 4 variables which the user chooses through the **Shiny App**
- Project strictly for implementation of **R-Shiny**, **Web Scraping**, **Data Manupulation**, and **GGplot** abilities. **Plot conclusions may/may not be accurate** due to insufficient data.
